The reporting manager has the authority to review the timesheet and approve or reject it. The list of all the projects in which you are staffed as reporting manager would be displayed in the timesheet approval section.

On the listing screen, the manager can see the week-wise hours of each project. Also, the manager would be able to see the total hours for each project.

**Note:** The manager can approve the timesheet, which was previously rejected and can reject the timesheet which was previously approved.

The manager can see the remarks added while rejecting the timesheet with the help of **“View Remarks”** option.

If the manager has approved the timesheet of an employee, the status of timesheet would be shown as **"approved"** for that employee in the status column.

If an employee has not added any tasks, then the status would be displayed as “Not Added” for that employee in the status column.

If the manager has rejected the timesheet of an employee, the status of timesheet would be shown as “rejected” for that employee in the status column.

If the employee has submitted the timesheet, the status of timesheet would be shown as “submitted” for that employee in the status column.

If an employee has both an approved or rejected timesheet and a submitted timesheet, the status of the entire timesheet in the status column for that employee will be marked as “submitted”.
