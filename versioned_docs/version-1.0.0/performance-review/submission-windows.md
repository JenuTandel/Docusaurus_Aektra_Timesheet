Submission windows are designated timelines during which each role is expected to complete their respective tasks.

1. **Self Review Timeline**

   * This is the designated timeline by which all employees are expected to complete  their self-review (answer submission) and submit the snapshot. 
   * In the event that the employee does not submit their snapshots within the designated timeline, the snapshot will be auto-submitted and escalated directly to the human resources department without undergoing reviewer evaluation.
2. **Manager Rating Timeline**

   * This is the designated timeline by which all reviewers are expected to complete the assessment of all assigned snapshots for review.
   * If the reviewer is not satisfied with the self-review answer, they should request a revision within this submission window.
   * In the event that the reviewer does not submit the snapshots for review within the designated timeline, the snapshot will be auto-submitted and escalated directly to human resources department.
